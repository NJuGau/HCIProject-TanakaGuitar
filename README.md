# HCIProject-TanakaGuitar
A group human computer interaction project to fulfill Binus University human computer interaction laboratory project. A website is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on predetermined requirements to provide better management of an online guitar shop. The website itself consists of 5 different pages, which are home, gallery, about us, contact us, and member registration page. A Figma prototype is made to visualize the web interface. Then, the whole website is made using pure HTML and CSS with the exception in registration page, that a JavaScript code is used to validate userâ€™s input. The website is also made with mobile device responsivity using media query.
